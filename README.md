# jessicas_library_2
added functionality to my library database project

# TODO:
### Barcode Scanning for Book Entry
- use a barcode scanner to scan a book's barcode (ISBN)
- Automatically decode the barcode to retrieve the ISBN number
- Fetch book details (title, author, publisher, publication date, rating) using the ISBN through an external API
- Save the retrieved book details to the library database

### SQLite database
Store book information in a relational database with fields for:
- Title
- Author(s)
- Publisher
- Publication Date
- Rating
  
### Data Analytics
Perform analytics on the library database to generate insights, such as:
- Most common genres or categories
- Popular authors or publishers
- Trends based on book types or publication years
- Book recommendations (API?)

### User Interface
Develop a GUI or command-line interface for users to:
- Add books via barcode scanning.
- View book details
- Search or filter books by various attributes (title, author, etc.).
- Display analytics results.

### Future Updates
- Portability: Package the project for cross-platform use with an intuitive setup.

### Goal
By the end of the project, I aim to have a fully functional library management tool that combines automation (barcode scanning and API integration), data storage, analytics, and user-friendly interfaces.
